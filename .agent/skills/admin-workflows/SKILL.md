# Admin Workflows

This skill details the administrative capabilities within the "Admin Portal" of Project SENTINEL, ensuring Fortune-500 level standards.

## RBAC Hierarchy
Access is controlled via a strict hierarchy:
1.  **Owner:** Full system control, billing management, and destructive actions.
2.  **Admin:** Project creation, user management within Tenants.
3.  **Editor:** Can modify content and active projects.
4.  **Analyst:** Read-only access to data and reports.

## Workflows

### 1. Proposal to Project
The lifecycle of a new engagement includes:
- Proposal submission
- Review and approval process
- Project initiation

### 2. Documentation Review
Ensure all documentation in the `docs/` directory is updated to reflect changes in workflows and processes.
